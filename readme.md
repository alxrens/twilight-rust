# ⮝ Arch Twilight ⮝

this project is the remastered version of my Twilight previous build. since the last bot kept dying for some reason, I decided to rewrite the bot in rust instead.



## Run This Project
I'll make the docker compose to make this project easier to be initialized(check the roadmap).

create a dotenv file on the root of this project file which looked like this:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=<DISCORD_TOKEN WILL BE IN HERE>
WAIFUIT_TOKEN<WAIFU.IT TOKEN GOES HERE> this one could be easily get by checking the waifu.it website
```
then you could just start the cargo command :

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Future Goal

I'll make docker compose or just dockerfile for now to make this project easier to be executed across platform.

But my main goal for this bot is to be able to do some useful and fun stuff with what everyone wants.

I tried to make a anime character claiming card command where everyone can play with this bot, but with a twist of there's bank system. so basically everyone has currency and then everyone could trade, bid, and sell their card to the bank. everyone can also be claiming the card by using similar to how credit payment work. Check the anicard branch if you want to see my progress.

If you interested in this project I'll be glad to work together in this project. and if you want to contribute you can pull a request.
